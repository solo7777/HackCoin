# HackCoin

## Idea

HackCoin is a cryptocurrency created to empower a free community of people on the internet who value freedom, openness, and access to information. We believe that technology should serve people without restrictions, and HackCoin aims to be a tool supporting those who fight for digital freedom and justice online.

## Goals

- Provide a decentralized and free way to exchange value within the internet community.
- Support projects that promote open access to knowledge and innovation.
- Build a transparent and reliable platform where every participant has equal rights.
- Foster a culture of responsible hacking and digital ethics.
